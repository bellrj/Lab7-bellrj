1. Using Selenium is useful because it allows us to run a series of test cases on our web page in a simple repeatable way rather than just 'testing it out' manually, it also directly uses the functionality of a web page like a user rather than just looking at the underlying code and verifying it is correct.

2. It (from my very limited experience) is only capable of testing certain types of content, ie. a flash based web page would be hard to test with it, also if there are any functional changes to the way a web page works it may break the test cases even if the user experience is the same.

3. <tr><td><a href="myCase.html">MyCase</a></tr></td>

4. <tr>
	<td>click</td>
	<td>//a[@id='myLink']/</td>
	<td></td>
   </tr>
5. Using HTML is nice because we are testing HTML, so it is easy to describe things using a similar language. Also, the structure is easy to understand, and allows for the linking of other tests into a test suite in a simle way. The problems will start to occur with complex test cases where it is difficult to understand what is going on as it can be difficult to know what a more complex line of of a test does (ie. //div[@id='cse']/div/div/div[5]/div[2]/div/div/div/div/table/tbody/tr/td[2]/div/a/b from the computerscience.html file).
